# `k.h` [![KDotH](https://github.com/chinmaygarde/kdoth/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/chinmaygarde/kdoth/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

A C library meant to be used a base library for other projects. Contains
utilities that I end up writing in one way or another over and over.

The umbrella header `k.h` should be all you need to import to use everything in
the library.
